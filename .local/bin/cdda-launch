# OVERVIEW:
# ---------
#
# This script handles save game backups before launching CDDA.  The user is
#   prompted as to whether or not they would like to restore the save backup
#   from the last launch.  If 'N', then the save game backups are rotated and
#   the current save/ directory is backed up, before the game is launched.  If
#   'Y', then the current save/ directory is backed up to
#   'prerestore-save.tar.gz', deleted, and the previously backed up save
#   archive is extracted, before the game is launched.
# The default is to not restore.
# Ten rolling archives of the save/ directory are kept, so that you can
#   manually roll back farther if needed.


# REQUIREMENTS:
# -------------
#
# You must install CDDA with the 'cdda-update' script before this one will
#   work.


# INSTALLATION:
# -------------
#
# Place this script somewhere in your path (I like to use ~/bin/, but suit
#   yourself).  Change CDDA_WORKING_DIR below to something that suits your
#   particular system.


# CONFIGURATION:
# --------------
#
# Set this to your CDDA working directory from the "cdda-update" script.  If
#   you change this, you will also need to change it there.
CDDA_WORKING_DIR=~/.local/cdda-dir
#
# Set this to 'Y' if you want this script to automatically install the newest
#   experimental version before launching.  The 'cdda-update' script must be
#   in your path for this to work.
AUTO_UPDATE=y
